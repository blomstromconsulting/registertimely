Standard Working Hours
Normal weekly working hours: 40 hours per week for full-time employment.
Daily rest: You must have at least 11 consecutive hours of rest within each 24-hour period.
Weekly rest: You must have at least 36 consecutive hours of rest per seven-day period (usually a weekend).
Key point: The standard 40-hour limit can be altered by collective agreements if an employer and a union have agreed to a different system (for example, a 38-hour or 37.5-hour workweek).
